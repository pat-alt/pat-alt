Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate in Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence at Delft University of Technology working on the intersection of Computer Science and Finance. My current research revolves around Counterfactual Explanations and Probabilistic Machine Learning. Previously, I worked as and Economist for the Bank of England.

I code in [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) ðŸ”´ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ¢ and write in [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev). Occasionally I also use R, Python and C++. After years of consuming open-source software, I've recently started contributing packages myself:

- [CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl)
- [LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/pat-alt/LaplaceRedux.jl)
